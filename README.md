## Description
This game prototype was made for a 1-week, game-design challenge. It is your first day at DOOP Corp. Tasks appear at the top of the screen and must be completed within the displayed time. Tasks include shredding reports, filing reports, sending reports via pneumatic tube, faxing report and making copies. All models, textures, and animations were created by me for this game.
